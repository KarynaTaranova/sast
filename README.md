# SASTY 
*Combination of tools for SAST Scanning*

[![](https://dockerbuildbadges.quelltext.eu/status.svg?organization=getcarrier&repository=sast)](https://hub.docker.com/r/getcarrier/sast/builds/)

### Quick and easy start
These simple steps will run blind SAST scan against your code and generate html and xml report with some low hanging fruits
Currently we have:
- python
- ruby

##### 1. Install docker
 
##### 2. Start container and pass 5 config options to container and mount reports folder:

`project_name` - the name of your project will be displayed in reports

`environment` - name of brunch or any other identified to be used in reports

`path_to_your_code` - path do the code on your local machine

`your_local_path_to_reports` - path on your local filesystem where you want to store reports from this execution

For example:

``` 
docker run -t \
       -e project_name=MY_PET_PROJECT -e environment=master \
       -v <your_local_path_to_reports>:/tmp/reports \
       -v <path_to_your_code>:/code \
       --name=dusty --rm \
       getcarrier/sast:latest -s sast
```

##### 3. Open scan report
Report is located in your `your_local_path_to_reports` folder

### Configuration
Scans can be configured using `scan-config.yaml` file.

##### scan-config.yaml structure
```
sast # Name of the scan
  # General configuration section
  target_host: $host          # host to scan (e.g. my.domain.com)
  target_port: $port          # port where it is hosted (e.g. 443)
  protocol: $protocol         # http or https
  project_name: $project_name # the name of the project used in reports
  environment: $environment   # literal name of environment (e.g. prod/stage/etc.)
  
  # Reporting configuration section (all report types are optional)

  # Scanners configurtion section (you can use only what you need)
  sslyze: true                # set to `true` in order to scan for ssl errors
  nmap:                       # nmap configuration
    inclusions: T:0-1000      # ports to scan
    exclusions: T:80,443      # ports expected to be discovered 
    nse_scripts: ssl-date     # additional NSE scripts 
    params: -v -A             # additional NMAP params
  zap:                        # OWASP zap confutation
    scan_types: xss           # types of vulnerabilities to scan
  masscan:                    # masscan configuration
    inclusions: 0-65535       # ports to scan
    exclusions: 80,443        # ports expected to be discovered
  nikto:                      # Nikto configuration
    # parameters for nikto to run with
    param: -Plugins @@ALL;-@@EXTRAS;-sitefiles;tests(report:500) -T 123x
  w3af:                       # w3af configuration
    # path to w3af configuraion within container
    config_file: /tmp/w3af_full_audit.w3af
  # Qualys WAS integration in tricky and 
  # require couple of secrets to be prebuilt into container
  # you will need to set QUALYS_LOGIN, QUALYS_PASSWORD and
  # QUALYS_API_SERVER to environment variables in order to make it work  
  qualys:
    # Qualys scan profile
    qualys_profile_id: SCAN_PROFILE_ID 
    # Qualys report temaple, probably we need to store example somewhere
    qualys_template_id: ID_OF_QUALYS_TEMPLATE 
    # Type of a scanner to use in Qualys
    qualys_scanner_type: INTERNAL | EXTERNAL 
    # In case you use INTERNAL you will need:
    qualys_scanner: NAME_OF_SCANNER  
```
configuration can be mounted to container like 
```
-v <path_to_local_folder>/scan-config.yaml:/tmp/scan-config.yaml
```

##### False positive filtering configuration
User need to fill `false_positive.config` file with titles of false-positive issues and mount it to container
```
-v <path_to_local_folder>/false_positive.config:/tmp/false_positive.config
```

##### Please note that `scan-config.yaml` and `false_positive.config` included for demo purposes
